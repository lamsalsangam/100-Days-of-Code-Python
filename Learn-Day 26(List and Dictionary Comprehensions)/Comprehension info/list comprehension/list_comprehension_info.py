'''
A list comprehension is a syntactic construct available in some programming languages for creating a list based on existing lists. 
It follows the form of the mathematical set-builder notation (set comprehension) as distinct from the use of map and filter functions.

# Example: new_list = [new_item for item in list]
# new_list = [n + 1 for n in numbers]
# name = "Sangam"
# letter_list = [letter for letter in name]
##########
# Conditional list Comprehension
# range_list = [num * 2 for num in range(1,5)]
# Example: new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]
# names = ['Ram', 'Hari', 'Krishna', "Shiva", "Utsav"]
# short_names = [name for name in names if len(name) < 5]
# long_names = [name.upper() for name in names if len(name) > 5]
